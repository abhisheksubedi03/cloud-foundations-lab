# cloud-foundations-lab

## What I’m Building
A secure AWS cloud foundation using best practices: IAM, networking, and infrastructure security.
This repo documents hands-on implementation, failures, and fixes.

## Why This Matters
Most cloud breaches happen due to misconfiguration.
This project focuses on building, breaking, and securing core AWS infrastructure.

## Current Status
Day 1: IAM setup and AWS account hardening (in progress)

## Architecture (High Level)
- AWS Account
- IAM User with least privilege
- MFA enabled
- Root account locked down

## Next Tasks
- Create secure VPC with public/private subnets
- Launch EC2 with restricted access
- Document security misconfigurations and fixes
